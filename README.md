# Ciao !

Ciao! I'm Vincenzo Cervellera and I attend MSc in Statistics (Data Science) at Imperial College London. I recently graduated with a BSc in Mathematical Enginneering at Politecnico of Milano.

Nowadays everything can be captured through data, but it is not trivial the way we analyze and make conclusions given these data.

That is why I decided to join this Master and in particular to throw myself into the Data Science world, with the aim of growing as critical thinker and project developer.

Last but not least I love sport, and it would be a dream for me to work in the sport field as a Data Scientist one day.
